						<p class="about-me">
							I'm from the Philippines but I was born and raised in Italy.
						    I'm grateful that my parents chose to live cross-culturally 
							as It heightened my awareness to the fascinating cultures that constantly surround me.
							In point of fact, I value, respect and gain knowledge from people, <strong>not regardless of their differences but because of their differences</strong>.

				  <h3>Personal growth</h3>
				    <p>
					  Upon reflection, the process of finally learning to code taught me one important thing: I was often my own biggest blocker.
					  Many of the excuses I had made were rarely based in reality, but instead justification not to start. <br>
					  When I came across  <a href="https://www.start2impact.it" target="_blank"><em>Start2impact</em></a> I instantly fancied the idea of “learning by doing”.
					  Moreover, as I was learning <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> I realized that these two powerful languages do not just provide the foundation of a website but 
					  they also allow you to bring out your personality on your own website and enhance your creativity in order to stand out and create the unexpected. <br>
					  As a full stack development student starting from square one, my intention is to learn valuable skills that I can build upon for years to come.
